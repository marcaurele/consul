# Upgrade Instructions

This document is intended to help customers who find themselves many versions behind to upgrade safely.
Our recommended upgrade path is moving from version 0.8.5 to 1.2.4 to 1.6.9 to the current version. To get
started, you'll want to choose the version you're currently on below and then follow the instructions
until you're on the latest version. The upgrade guides will mention notable changes and link to relevant
changelogs â€“ we recommend reading through the changelog for versions between the one you're on and the
one you're upgrading to at each step to familiarize yourself with changes.
